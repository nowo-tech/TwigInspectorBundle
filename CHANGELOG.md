## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.5] - 2024-12-15

### Fixed
- **Wildcard Pattern Matching**: Fixed regex pattern matching in `HtmlCommentsExtension::isExcluded()`
  - Changed from `str_replace` to `preg_quote()` for proper escaping of special regex characters
  - Now correctly handles wildcard patterns like `admin/*` and `email/*.html.twig`
- **Test Suite**: Fixed all test failures and compatibility issues
  - Removed `Application::add()` calls (removed in Symfony 8.0) from all tests
  - Fixed constructor parameter mismatches in `HtmlCommentsExtension` tests
  - Fixed `TemplateWrapper` mock issue (class is final, cannot be mocked)
  - Fixed test for non-numeric line numbers to handle Symfony 7.0+ exceptions
  - Fixed help text test to verify command definition instead of output
  - All 114 tests now pass with 95.10% code coverage

## [1.0.4] - 2024-12-15

### Fixed
- **Route Pattern**: Updated route requirements to allow slashes in template names
  - Changed from `"[^/\\0]+"` to `"[^\\0]+"` to support templates in subdirectories (e.g., `admin/users/list.html.twig`)
  - Security validations in `OpenTemplateController` already prevent path traversal attacks
  - Added test for templates in subdirectories

## [1.0.3] - 2024-12-15

## [1.0.2] - 2024-12-12

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Compatibility**: Fixed CI workflow to handle different PHP versions correctly
  - Changed `composer install` to `composer update` in CI jobs to resolve dependencies based on PHP version
  - Updated `symfony/yaml` version constraint from `^8.0` to `^6.0 || ^7.0 || ^8.0` for PHP 8.2/8.3 compatibility
