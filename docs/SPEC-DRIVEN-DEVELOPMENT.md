# Spec-driven development

In this repository, **spec-driven development** has two layers that stay in sync:

1. **Product behavior** — what **TwigInspectorBundle** guarantees to applications that integrate it (see [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md), [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md), [`INSTALLATION.md`](INSTALLATION.md)). **PHPUnit** and **PHPStan** enforce contracts in CI where applicable.
2. **Traceability anchors** — stable **`REQ-*`** identifiers in Makefiles and demos (when present) so changes to scripts, ports, and demo workflows stay discoverable from issues and PRs.

There is no separate executable spec language (for example Gherkin); tests and static analysis are the mechanical proof alongside this document.

## User stories

The sections below state **behavior**; this subsection states **intent** in backlog-friendly form.

| ID | Story |
| --- | --- |
| US-01 | **As a** Symfony integrator, **I want** to install and enable this package **so that** I can rely on documented services, configuration, and extension points. |
| US-02 | **As an** integrator, **I want** stable configuration keys and defaults **so that** upgrades remain predictable (see [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md)). |
| US-03 | **As an** integrator, **I want** clear usage guidance **so that** I can integrate features without reverse-engineering internals (see [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md)). |
| US-04 | **As a** maintainer, **I want** behavior changes covered by automated tests **so that** regressions are caught in CI. |
| US-05 | **As a** contributor, **I want** `REQ-*` anchors on scripted flows **so that** PRs and issues cite the same identifiers as this document. |

**Out of scope for these stories:** guarantees outside the stated public API and outside dependency limits (PHP, Symfony, third-party libraries).

## Bundle functional scope

**Goal:** Debug Twig templates in the browser: visual overlay, click-to-open in IDE, Web Profiler. Symfony 6|7|8.

**In scope**

- Documented integration (see root `README.md` and `docs/`).
- Configuration and runtime behavior described in [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md) and [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md).
- Consumer-facing change notes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md) when applicable.

**Explicit non-goals**

- Behavior not documented here or in linked integrator docs.
- **`demo/`** trees: illustrative unless a path is explicitly published as stable API in this document.

**Demos** (if present): examples only; not part of the Packagist contract unless services or contracts are explicitly documented as stable.

---

## Validating the functional spec

- Run **`composer qa`** and/or **`make qa`** / **`make release-check`** as documented in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) (Docker-based flows may apply).
- Run **PHPUnit** and **PHPStan** in CI and locally for code changes.
- New or changed behavior should add or adjust **tests** under `tests/` (or the repo’s documented test layout) rather than relying on prose alone.

## Requirement identifiers (`REQ-*`)

| ID | Where | What it marks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(none yet)* | `Makefile`, `demo/**/Makefile` | Add `REQ-*` comments next to targets when scripted behavior must stay traceable; document each ID here. |

When you change scripted behavior, **update the existing `REQ-*` comment** if the ID still matches the rule, or **add a new `REQ-*`** and document it here and in the PR description.

---

## Suggested workflow for contributors

1. **Clarify behavior** in an issue or draft PR: acceptance criteria for the **product** and, if relevant, **Makefiles/demos** (`REQ-*`).
2. **Implement** with tests and static analysis.
3. **Anchor scripts and demos** when dev UX changes: add or adjust `REQ-*` comments and this table.
4. **Ship integrator docs** when behavior or configuration changes: [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md), [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md), [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), and [`UPGRADING.md`](UPGRADING.md) when consumers must change code or config.

## Relationship to Engram / external checklists

[`ENGRAM.md`](ENGRAM.md) covers Nowo-wide documentation checklist items. This document ties together **what the package does**, **how we verify it**, and **local `REQ-*` habits**. Both coexist: Engram for org-level compliance, this file for product + traceability expectations.
