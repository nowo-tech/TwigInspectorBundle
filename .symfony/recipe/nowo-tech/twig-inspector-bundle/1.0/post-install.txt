Twig Inspector Bundle has been installed!

The following files have been created:
  - config/packages/nowo_twig_inspector.yaml (configuration)
  - config/routes.yaml (routes import, if file didn't exist)

You can customize the configuration according to your needs.
The bundle works with default values if you delete the config file.

To use the bundle:
1. Make sure Symfony Web Profiler is enabled
2. Access your application in dev environment
3. Enable the inspector via the Web Profiler toolbar (</> icon)

Note: If routes.yaml already existed, the route import was added automatically.
If you need to add it manually, see the README for instructions.
